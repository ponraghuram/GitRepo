My best friend's birthday
We always have at least one person with whom our vibes will be in sync. 
We don't have to express what we feel about something but a simple glance at each
 other's eyes would be enough to put you both in a laughing mode. 
Likewise, sometimes, whatever fight you have, it just would take one simple 
lame joke to get you both back from a very serious face.


 Though the friendship may not be always amusing,
 and though we always have things we can't completely agree on without
 any debates, and though we would have had some serious fights 
due to possessiveness or whatever, what matters is how 
you've always been there for each other when some outsider
 picks up a fight with either one of you.
 Your true serious faces will emerge then, together.


Your friend, he or she, may not have had the time to talk to you due to all the 
quarantine and stuff, or due to distance, or even due to work. 
But when a call comes from them, our faces would impulsively light up. 
Some people would even put up a fight for not calling for so many days and act like sadists, but even if we don't know instantly, we would for sure in a little more time, would realize that they enjoyed and smiled fighting on the other side of the phone.
